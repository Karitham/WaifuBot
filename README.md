## About

This is a waifu/husbando discord bot, it is pretty stable but some commands might change.

It uses [Disgord go lib](github.com/andersfylling/disgord), [Anilist's GraphQL API](https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs) and [mongoDB](https://mongodb.com)

You can add the bot to your server [using this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=712332547694264341&permissions=0)
